What other technologies should i use to improve  quality of code and work?

SASS - Now I can see how SASS preprocessors can improve work efficiency and I will definitely learn more about them and use them in further larger projects like this one.

If I had been doing this project from scratch, what would I have changed in it? What would I improve?
____________

There is one thing that annoys me - the point is that I did the entire project without any subpages. I thought to myself "I will make a website without subpages, all the content will change dynamically, it will be great!". Well, in the end, after spending a few days learning the basics of SEO, I discovered why certain HTML tags are so important, what optimization is all about, and why internal and external links raise SEO points. However, I left this project as it is to commemorate my first website and draw conclusions. Despite the lack of subpages, thanks to the knowledge I have acquired about SEO, I was able to increase the SEO-score from 46% to 84% using free SEO tools. I think this lesson taught me a lot about the very structure of HTML.
